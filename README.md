# Microsoft Fabric Lab â€“ Create and Use Dataflows (Gen2)

## Overview
This lab demonstrates how to create and use **Dataflows (Gen2)** in Microsoft Fabric to ingest, transform, and load data into a Lakehouse environment. It also shows how to orchestrate the data ingestion process using a pipeline.

## Steps Completed

1. **Workspace Creation**
   - Created a new workspace with Microsoft Fabric trial enabled.

2. **Lakehouse Creation**
   - Built a new Lakehouse to store ingested data.

3. **Dataflow (Gen2) Setup**
   - Ingested data from a CSV file using Power Query Online.
   - Performed data transformation:
     - Added a custom column `MonthNo` using `Date.Month([OrderDate])`.
   - Verified data types and transformation steps.

4. **Data Destination Configuration**
   - Connected the Dataflow output to the previously created Lakehouse.
   - Saved the table as `orders`.

5. **Pipeline Integration**
   - Created a Data Pipeline.
   - Added a Dataflow activity and linked it to the `Dataflow 1`.
   - Successfully ran the pipeline and ingested data into the Lakehouse.

6. **Validation**
   - Verified that the `orders` table was created and loaded with the expected data.

## Notes
- Power Query Online was used for transformations.
- Authentication was set to Anonymous for the public CSV file.
- This lab is designed for learning and not intended for production-level scenarios.

## Resources Used
- Microsoft Fabric Trial
- Dataset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/dp-data/main/orders.csv
